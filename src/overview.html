JOPS - the Java-Originated Presentation System - a proof-of-concept for 
a potential future replacement of the University Radio York Broadcasting 
and Presentation System.

<P>It has been created by URY Computing Officer Matt Windsor as a proof 
that the Java programming language is capable of hosting a 
broadcast/presentation system similar to the current BAPS system; it is 
hoped that JOPS will be further useful as a guideline or source of code 
for the design/implementation of any such replacement.</P>

<P>JOPS is a client/server design, using a server to play music, a 
client to interact with the user, and a PostgreSQL database to store 
music song lists.</P>

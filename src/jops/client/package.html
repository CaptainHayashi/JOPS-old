The JOPS client and related classes.

<P>The JOPS client is the process responsible for communicating with 
the system user.</P>

<P>The client provides a Swing Graphical User Interface through which 
the user can control the server, eg by creating players, assigning songs 
to players, starting and stopping the players, and editing and deleting 
the players.</P>

<P>It communicates with the server through TCP/IP - the server need not 
be on the same computer as the client.</P>

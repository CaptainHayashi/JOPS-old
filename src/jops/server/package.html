The JOPS server and related classes.

<P>The JOPS server is the process responsible for playing sound. At the 
time of writing, it has been written with FLAC and MP3 support in mind, 
although it uses the JavaSound SPI system to play music and should 
theoretically support any format that JavaSound supports natively in 
addition.</P>

JOPS (Java-Orientated Presentation System)

An incomplete proof-of-concept broadcasting and presentation system in 
Java.  This project was originally started as a testbed both to develop 
Java skills and also to explore/demonstrate the usability of Java to 
replace the current system at University Radio York, and will still be 
developed at least up until an actual replacement project is started.

JOPS is, at time of writing, incomplete, with the following issues:

1) The protocol was written from scratch, making it completely 
incompatible with existing systems.

2) It does not yet support cuing, timing management or loading songs in 
any manner other manually inserting into an (again incompatible) 
database schema.

3) Only FLAC and MP3 songs are presently supported, with direct input 
considered for the future.

4) Some of the player controls (notably, edit player) do not work.

USAGE

You will need the following libraries in classpath:

- jflac-1.3.jar
- jl1.0.1.jar
- mp3spi1.9.5.jar
- tritonus_share.jar
- postgresql-9.0-801.jdbc4.jar

Newer versions might work.

JOPS has been coded in Eclipse, and thus should work nicely as an 
Eclipse project.
